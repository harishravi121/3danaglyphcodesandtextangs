3d html codes of anaglyphs. Type whatever and see in 3d. Greatly useful for children to make study inspiring. Please see in red cyan glasses worth 300 re.. We are attracted to a normal screen becoming a 3d screen which costs 100 times more if we had 3d pixels so we shouldn't always look for it.. also we have doubts like whats the distance between red cyan and front back transform which needs a phd atleast.. so we can go for our interest.

The teacher would have to show it on monitor and students wear glasses? Also 3d games would be great fun! Racing etc. This is still yet to show results but I saw anaglyph in childhood.

Language 3d lang codes and texts have to spoken out and recorded for best effects. I will put a few online. Thanks to google translate too!
