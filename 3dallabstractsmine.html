The ability to transport energy is a fundamental property of the two-dimensional Dirac fermions in graphene. Electronic thermal transport in this system is relatively unexplored and is expected to show unique fundamental properties and to play an important role in future applications of graphene, including optoelectronics, plasmonics, and ultrasensitive bolometry. Here, we present measurements of bipolar thermal conductances due to electron diffusion and electron-phonon coupling and infer the electronic specific heat, with a minimum value of 10 k B (10− 22 J/K) per square micron. We test the validity of the Wiedemann-Franz law and find that the Lorenz number equals 1.32×(π 2/3)(k B/e) 2. The electron-phonon thermal conductance has a temperature power law T 2 at high doping levels, and the coupling parameter is consistent with recent theory, indicating its enhancement by impurity scattering. We demonstrate …

We demonstrate that the Hanle effect can be tuned between magnetically induced absorption (MIA) and magnetically induced transmission (MIT) simply by changing the polarization of the input laser beam. The experiments are done using closed hyperfine transitions of the D 2 line of 133 Cs—F g= 3→ F e= 2 and F g= 4→ F e= 5. The former shows a transformation from MIT to MIA, while the latter shows the opposite behavior. A qualitative explanation based on optical pumping and coherences among the magnetic sublevels of the ground state is borne out by a detailed density-matrix calculation. To increase the coherence time, the experiments are done in a Cs vapor cell with paraffin coating on the walls. The observed linewidth is extremely narrow (∼ 0.1 mG) compared to previous work in this area, making this a promising technique for all kinds of precision measurements.


We have developed a technique for precise measurement of small magnetic fields using nonlinear magneto-optic rotation (NMOR). The technique relies on the resonant laser beam being chopped. During the on time, the atoms are optically pumped into an aligned ground state (Δm= 2 coherence). During the off time, they freely precess around the magnetic field at the Larmor frequency. If the on-off modulation frequency matches (twice) the Larmor precession frequency, the rotation is resonantly enhanced in every cycle, thereby making the process like a repeated Ramsey measurement of the Larmor frequency. We study chopped-NMOR in a paraffin-coated Cs vapor cell. The out-of-phase demodulated rotation shows a Lorentzian peak of linewidth 85 μG, corresponding to a sensitivity of. We discuss the potential of this technique for the measurement of an atomic electric-dipole moment.

Time resolved photon counting was used to separate the different photon states emitted from a strongly attenuated laser source. We first describe a method to quantify the efficiency of our gated avalanche photo-detector, by relying on known Poissonian statistics. The detector was then optimized under different temperature and bias voltage conditions using the noise equivalent power as a metric. Finally, coherent pulses are sent into a ring cavity, such that the tapped output from the cavity forms a series of time multiplexed pulses, which then yield the photon counting statistics. We observed good agreement between theoretical estimates and experimental observations, to as low as 0.01% probability of detection.

We present here a set of simple experiments through which various characteristics of a DC motor can be investigated. The experiments also provide insights on how to control a DC motor. We first study the back-emf versus angular speed and the torque versus current characteristics. We then extract the moment of inertia of the rotor and the speedtorque curve for the load from the start-stop dynamics of the motor. Finally, we study an alternate way of obtaining the angular speed from the back-emf waveform.
